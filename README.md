## The Discord bot about space
Space is cool, join the mission with this bot.

## Commands
Available commands are slash commands. List:
- clear (clear messages)
- issnow (where is the ISS now?)
- ping (bot latency)
- spaceimg (nasa daily image)
- support (join Space Hub Discord)

## Hosting
- Create a Discord bot and enable all intents
- Clone the repo
- Put those values in a file called .env
```
TOKEN=urtoken
CLIENT_ID=botclientid
STAFF_CHANNEL_ID=a channel id for staff news / updates
NASA_API_KEY=an API key for NASA (https://api.nasa.gov/)

```
- Install nodejs and yarn
- Run tsc in the root of the project
- Run the dist/index.js file
If those instructionsa are unclear and you don't know any programming language / you don't know how to use a terminal, then hosting this bot is not for you, if you can use a terminal, just open an issue
